Googleâ€™s Updates About the Importance of Link Building

Here's Googe's Documentation and what is said there about links:



-Google finds pages through links from other pages. 



And according to recent Google updates: "First, backlinks as a signal have a lot less significant impact than when Google Search first started many years ago. We have robust ranking signals, hundreds of them, to make sure that we can rank the most relevant and useful results for all queries."



Also: "Chances are, there are a number of sites that cover topic areas similar to yours. Opening up communication with these sites is usually beneficial. Hot topics in your niche or community could spark additional ideas for content or building a good community resource."

Plus, on a recent poll on Twitter, 44.3% of voting SEOs agree that Link Building is as effective as it always was.



Therefore, the quantity and quality of links still play a huge role in indicating how valuable and important your site is for rankings. Your linking patterns help Google understand your site. Beyond only rankings, it is also the best method for Google to discover web-pages.



With all this in mind, planning out your link and anchor strategy stays at the top of your SEO and Local SEO efforts. 



This brings us to the next section to determine the types of links to look for when building your Local SEO link graph.

Google aims to show users relevant results, and acquiring geo-relevant backlinks will make the difference in understanding your relevancy to the geographical location.

Niche-relevant backlinks will be your golden ticket toward increasing rankings as they help Google understand what your website and content are all about.
